# 📊 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to calculate and interpret essential evaluation metrics for classification models, including:

Accuracy

Sensitivity (Recall)

Specificity

Precision

F1-Score

The implementation shows both manual calculations (from scratch) and optimized versions using scikit-learn functions.

# 🔍 Key Features
✅ Manual implementation of all metrics without ML libraries
✅ Complete confusion matrix analysis
✅ Percentage conversion utilities
✅ Comparison between manual and scikit-learn calculations
✅ Detailed metric explanations and use cases
